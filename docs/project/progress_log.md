### Project Development

- Set up the project using Astro.

### Layout Design

- Integrated a layout called `BaseLayout`.

### Component Integration

- Integrated the following components:
  - `Navigation`
  - `SkipLink`
  - `SiteFooter`
  - `SiteHead`
  - `SiteHeader`

### Page Setup

- Created the `index` (home) file, as well as the `contact` and `portfolio` index pages.

### Content Addition

- Added content for the portfolio under the collection named "projects".
- Added 2 collection "items" for testing purposes.

### TODO

- Create a second Layout to be used on all pages except the home page, which includes an additional `margin-block-start` on the main element.
- Mutate the files in `docs/content` to Markdown format to be usable within the content.
- Define the project design tokens.
- Initialize the project on GitHub and deploy.
- Identify the sections, main elements/components, and the macro & micro layout.

## 2024-07-05 - Morning

### Layout Development

- Developed `LayoutDefault` for diverse page designs, distinct from the home page layout, with `SiteHeader` and `SiteFooter`. This layout introduces styling for visual distinction and content presentation. Adjusted `BaseLayout` for SEO enhancements and clarified the distinct purposes of `LayoutDefault` and `LayoutLanding`, emphasizing design flexibility across the site.

## 2024-07-04 - Afternoon

### SVG Integration

- Addressed SVG integration in the Astro project by consolidating SVGs into a single file for efficient use. This approach enhanced the project's SVG management, aligning with Astro's build process and architecture, and included dynamic SVG icon rendering for improved accessibility and style consistency.

### Content

- Converted project files to .md for dynamic content display and improved content management.

### Base Value Configuration

- Addressed `base` value configuration by integrating `CONFIG_SITE` and `CONFIG_BASE` constants, optimizing navigation for GitHub Pages deployment.

### Deployment

- Successfully deployed the site to GitHub Pages, enhancing project visibility and providing a platform for live testing and feedback.

### TODO

- Define the project design tokens.
- Identify the sections, main elements/components, and the macro & micro layout.
